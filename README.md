Project_DmelanoNMJ
==================

Analysing genetically modfied D. melanogaster's muscle activity patterns during pupae development using image analysis to generate quantitative data.

The entry data entails:
1. A 512x512 resultion, 8-bit, gray-scale, maximum-intensity image which shows the muscle area of interest.
2. A stack of multiple 32x32p resolution, 16-bit, gray-scale images, shwoing the same area of interest, at a 10Hz frequency.

The Fly.class includes all necessary data which can be implemented into a standard GUI and allows a graphical representation of the activity pattern of all identified muscles.
